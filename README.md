Timed quiz

# User Story
AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

# What I Did
* I first started psuedo coding out what would be the basic blocks for the code.
* I then just started trying to get the start button on screen.
* I then moved on to working with my group to get the quiz to start.
* After getting the questions to load, I went on to getting the quiz to recognize what was right and what was wrong.
* Finally I could start with a timer and setting up on the screen.
* I then had the countdown timer started and was able to get the subtraction go from the wrong answers.
* Thanks to help from our study group I was able to get the end game screen to load correctly.
* I then used Bootstrap and tried to design it more with some custom css for a unique look.
* Unfortunetly I ran out of time and wasn't able to figure out the local storage, and how to get the names to stick.
